PocketRealm is a fun, feature-packed, community-driven, eventful, and friendly Minecraft: Pocket Edition survival server.

## About
PocketRealm runs many custom plugins that enhance the experience of a Minecraft: Pocket Edition survival server. Grief protection, chest locking, homes, web interface, logging, stats, warps, events are just some of many. Additionally we host interesting events weekly which reward the user with prizes for participation and victory. Battlegrounds, mob arenas, sieges, mini-games, and many other events are hosted by our event coordinators. We treat each and every user with respect and kindness, so drama and malice are not appreciated nor tolerated.
